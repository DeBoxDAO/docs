### DeBoxDAO Development Organization

The DeBoxDAO development organization recruits like-minded friends to continue building the ecology together. Friends who need production research and operation teams can build together for a long time.

I hope to have friends to build an open, friendly and inclusive DAO cultural ecology together. Hope to find some like-minded friends and do something meaningful together!

In the short term, there is no plan or plan to apply for official funding. At present, everything is voluntary and public welfare, so the current project focus will be more inclined to promote ecological prosperity and public welfare. Generate electricity with love, build with heart!
